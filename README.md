# The_Streets

This is a continuation of my last game "Street Combat" I got a bit too messy with the last one and decided it would be easier to start over because 
I had a few different ideas on how I wanted to layout my code. 

My favorite game as a kid was street fighter on Nintendo so that is most of my inspiration for this game. It is going to be a much more simple version of that.
Maybe as time goes on I can continue adding to it to make it better or I can release new versions that get progressively better. 

This is all for fun and educational practice for myself.
